## OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library
### About OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. Designed to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications, OpenCV accelerates the integration of machine perception into commercial products. Licensed under Apache 2, OpenCV allows businesses and developers to freely use, modify, and distribute the code, fostering innovation and collaboration in the field of computer vision.
Key Features

OpenCV offers a wide range of functionalities, such as:

    Image Processing: Read, write, and manipulate images with advanced filtering and transformation techniques.

    Video Analysis: Capture, process, and save videos, including motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking.

    Feature Detection: Detect edges, corners, and other key features in images and videos.

    Object Detection: Identify specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, and more using pre-trained models or custom implementations.

    Machine Learning Integration: Seamlessly integrate machine learning models for tasks like classification, regression, and clustering.

    3D Reconstruction: Create 3D models from 2D images using stereo vision and structure-from-motion techniques.

    Augmented Reality: Develop AR applications with real-time object tracking and overlay capabilities.
