This pull request implements HDR (High Dynamic Range) image processing using the Robertson and Reinhard tonemapping algorithms in the OpenCV library. 

**Details**:
- Added functions for HDR image creation and tonemapping using both the Robertson and Reinhard algorithms.
- Integrated a user-friendly interface to allow users to apply these techniques easily.
- Updated documentation to include usage examples and parameter descriptions.

**Benefits**:
- Improves the image processing capabilities of OpenCV by enabling better representation of images with extreme lighting conditions.
- Users can achieve more realistic images with better detail retention in both highlights and shadows.

**Testing**:
- Conducted tests on a set of HDR images to validate the functionality of the implemented algorithms.
- Verified that the output images retain the expected quality and detail after tonemapping.

**Future Work**:
- Further optimizations can be explored for the tonemapping process to enhance performance on large images.
- Additional algorithms for HDR processing can be considered for future implementations.
