Plot {#plot}
============

This Plot class allows you to easily plot data from a Mat or an std::vector. You can plot 1D or 2D plots, change the window size and the axis limits. 
The plot of data is simply done with:
@code
    Plot(src, figureName);
@endcode

These are just two examples of functions being plotted:

sin(x)
