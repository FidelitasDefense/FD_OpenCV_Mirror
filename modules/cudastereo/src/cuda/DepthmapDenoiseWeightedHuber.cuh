//! OpenDTAM Variant of Chambolle & Pock denoising
//!
//! The complicated half of the DTAM algorithm's mapping core,
//! but can be used independently to refine depthmaps.
//!
//! Written by Paul Foster for GSoC 2014 OpenDTAM project.
//! High level algorithm described by Richard Newcombe, Steven J. Lovegrove, and Andrew J. Davison.
//! "DTAM: Dense tracking and mapping in real-time."
//! Which was in turn based on Chambolle & Pock's
//! "A first-order primal-dual algorithm for convex problems with applications to imaging."
